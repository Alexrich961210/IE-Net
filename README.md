# IE-Net

This project is the Pytorch implementation of the submitted Electronics manuscript: IE-Net: Information Enhanced Binary Neural Networks for Accurate Classification.

**IE-Net**

The IE-Net is an accurate binary neural network with information enhancement. We build our model based on the current Pytorch implementation of basic deep neural networks. We just replace the full-precision convolution in DNNs with our proposed binary convolution.

**Network Structure**

We evaluate our proposed method on the commonly-used deep models such as ResNet-18, ResNet-20, VGG-Small for CIFAR-10 dataset, and ResNet-18, ResNet-34 for ImageNet dataset.  We binarize all the layers except the first and last layers and apply Hardtanh as the nonlinear function for a fair comparison.

**Training Settings**

Our IE-Net is trained from scratch without using any pre-trained technologies. For the CIFAR-10 dataset, we train all the binary models for 400 epochs and set the weight decay as 1e-4. For the ImageNet dataset, we train all the binary models for 120 epochs and set the weight decay as 1e-4. For both datasets, we choose the SGD with momentum as the optimizer and apply the cosine annealing strategy to decay the learning rate.
